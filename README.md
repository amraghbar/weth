# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## Features
- Fetch weather data from OpenWeatherMap based on a user-entered ZIP code.
- Allows the user to enter a personal note about the weather.
- Dynamically updates the UI with the date, temperature, and user note.

## Project Files
- server.js: Handles the backend logic and routes using Node.js and Express.
- website/app.js: Implements client-side logic for interacting with the API and updating the UI.
- index.html: Contains the structure and elements of the web application.
- style.css: Provides styles for the application.
